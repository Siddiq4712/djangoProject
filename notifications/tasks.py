# notifications/tasks.py
# This file would contain background tasks, typically run by Celery.

# Example if using Celery:
# from celery import shared_task
# from .utils import send_due_reminders

# @shared_task
# def send_daily_reminders_task():
#     send_due_reminders()

# To run this daily, you'd configure Celery Beat.
# For a simple local setup (without Celery), you could trigger `send_due_reminders()`
# via a Django management command or a simple cron job.

# For now, this is a placeholder. You'd manually call send_due_reminders()
# if not setting up a full task queue.
